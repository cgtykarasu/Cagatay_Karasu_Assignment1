In this assignment, you need to make a Rock-Scissors-Paper Game application.
Here are the rules: Rock breaks scissors, scissor cuts paper and paper eats rock. You are going to play against the computer. The first player who gets 5 points wins the game.
In each iteration, the computer should randomly select Rock, Scissor or Paper by using Random function. You need to write what you choose.
If you and the computer choose the same thing, noone gets point. If computer beats you, it will get 1 point. Otherwise you will.
You should use statements, variable assignments, if-else / switch statements, while / for loops, Scanner / JOptionPane classes that we covered in the lectures so far
